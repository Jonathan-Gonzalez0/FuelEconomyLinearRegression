This project demonstrates the implementation of a linear regression model to predict the Miles Per Gallon (MPG) of vehicles based on their horsepower. 
The project uses Python's data manipulation and machine learning libraries, including Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib, to create and evaluate the model.

Features:
Data Loading and Visualization: Load the dataset and generate visual insights to understand the relationship between horsepower and MPG.
Data Splitting: Divide the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Build a linear regression model using Scikit-Learn.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using the RÂ² metric.
Visualization: Plot the regression line against training and testing datasets.

The following features were used:
Python 3.12
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-Learn
FuelEconomy.csv (Ensure that the dataset is present in the same directory).
